Hi all,

Once you have purchased the app, you must obtain permission to redistribute it. Leave a message here. Also, which websites you decide to ping, it is your decision.

The app does not collect any personal information. It does not store any useful information at all. However, you may manually record which servers you are testing, if you wish.




Cheers, Keifmeister.
